/**	Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself 
 * automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage 
 * being handled automatically by the container. 
 * 
 * Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage (an array) so that they
 * can be accessed and traversed using iterators. 
 * 
 * In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes 
 * differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending the 
 * array. Removing the last element takes only constant time because no 
 * resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the 
 * middle is linear in time.
