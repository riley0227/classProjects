# Dungeon Doors 3D Game

Authors: Will Blodget, Sam James, Jessica Chammas, Riley Thompson, Jackson Keus, Nathan Maayah

### Basic Gameplay:
In this game, you will go through levels of increasing intensity and fight enemies. You can fight with your fists or buy more damage-inducing weapons at the shop. You have to defeat all of the enemies in the room in order to complete the level and a door to the next level will appear that you must go through to move on.

### Aspects:
- Shop for new combat tools
- Go through levels with an increasing # of enemies
- Door to the next room spawns when you kill all the enemies
- Backpack increases inventory space (can purchase unlimited)
- Can buy more heart capacity (or sometimes appear in levels)
- no cap of levels, though it gets very hard very quick (used to have a 10 level max)
- Stamina - you can sprint, but then can get fatigued quicker (top right bar)
- Room 0 - used for testing, can pick up items to test (turn into spawning room)
- Can play in "creative mode" where all weapons and additives are available in room 0
      - or play actually where you start with nothing and have to buy everything at the shop
- Every 4 rooms you go to the shop between level spawning (can only buy 1 of each weapon)
- You can hit enemies out of the room (no ceiling) for fun with certain more intense weapons
- Controls page that tells you how to play
- Torches and doors are point lights (also have the sun)

### People Split:
- Setup, Room, Levels, character, & lighting - Sam
- Shop canvas & manager - Jessica
- Inventory/Backpack/player hearts&healing/collectables, menu/controls & lots of ideas/pizzazz! - Will
- Punching/player movement/player cam - Nathan
- Enemy spawner/door spawner/death spawner - Jackson 
- Weapon prefabs/weapon holder/sound effects - Riley
- (we did most of this pair-programming style so we were all involved in ideas while one person coded each)

### Issues Encountered:
- Aspect ratios
- Weapon animations (gif -> sprite sheet)
- Shop button navigation
- Enemies spawning outside of the map
- inventory is hard
